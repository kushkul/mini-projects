Data used from Cats Vs Dogs Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) containing 1500 images of cats and dogs each.

Model Developed - A simple model containing 4 Convolutional Layers, 4 MaxPooling Layers and 2 Dense Layers was trained from scratch using RMS Prop optimizer for 10 epoches.

Improvements possible:
1. Using transfer learning for better performance.
2. Using larger datasets available on internet to train the model without overfitting.
3. Adding more layers to the model to learn complex features.
4. Use of Dropout to avoid overfitting.
5. Using callbacks to monitor overfitting and stop training as soon as training accuracy reaches a specific target.
6. Experimenting with other optimizers such as Adam
